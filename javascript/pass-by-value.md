# Call by value

JavaScript is always call-by-value. Objects hold their values as references, so outer members may be changed by a function. This can act like a call-by-reference. Could be referred to as [Call by sharing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation_strategy#Call_by_sharing), but the term is used inconsistently.
