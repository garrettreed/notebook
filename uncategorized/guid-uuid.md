# GUID vs UUID

- GUID: Globally Unique Identifier
- UUID: Universally Unique Identifier
- Both are 16 byte (128 bit value used for unique-ness
- Really no meaningful difference. Microsoft uses "GUID"
- GUIDs are commonly represented by hex digits in several groups separated by dashes
- All UUIDs are GUIDs, but not necessarily the other way, depending on whose side you're on.
