# Fakes, Mocks, and Stubs

Fake: object that has working implementation, but different from production. Usually simplified. For example, doesnâ€™t use database but stores data in memory for length of test.

Stub: Object that holds predefined data. Like a fake database.

Mock: Object that registers calls it receives in order to test that all expected actions are performed.
