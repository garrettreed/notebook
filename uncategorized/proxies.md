# Proxies

-   An intermediary between requests from clients and responses from servers.
-   A proxy server that passes unmodified requests and responses is usually called a gateway or sometimes a tunneling proxy.
-   Forward proxy: internet-facing proxy that retrieves data.
    -   Anonymous, for hiding the originating IP address
    -   Transparent, useful for caching
-   Reverse proxy: (uaually) internet-facing that controls and protects access to a server on a private network, i.e. load balancing, authentication, decryption, and caching. Named because it serves only a restricted set of websites.
