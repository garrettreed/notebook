# Webflow Evaluation

-   Impressed by (mostly) full CSS abilities.
-   Will require designers to have CSS knowledge
-   Desktop first, not mobile.
-   Rigid breakpoints. Will be some issues with responsiveness, but this can be designed around
-   Benefits only appear when designers build in the platform, with some developer help
-   CMS is alright. Can use “symbols” or repeated elements for globals. Custom styles will require no default style and using a parent class to set. Would require using the layout editor instead of the CMS, risking fucking things up.
-   If an element needs multiple classes, those classes are tied in a “combo”. Can’t edit class on its own. Possible to bypass by creating an element, adding the new class, then deleting it. Not ideal, so classes will be heavily tied to their elements. Less reuse.
